# Yelosan Publishing definitions
#
# date: first date when the work was written
#   - as per Copyright laws, the first time a work is penned is the date of Copyright, this include pre-publication
#   - publishdate comes first (see below) as it will affect the following:
#     - permalink date
#     - position of article (majority of themes were designed for 'date' and not 'publishdate')
# publishdate: first date of publication
# lastmod: latest significant update
#   - do not change for minor updates, the article and/or site might get flagged by search engines
# expirydate: when the article is no longer relevant

expirydate = ["expirydate", "unpublishdate"]                                           # :default = ["expiryDate", "unpublishdate"]
